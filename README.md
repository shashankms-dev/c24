# c24
The C programming language, a safe and modern implementation.
To be implemented in Rust initially, will be self-hosted later.

Using LLVM compiler development framework - https://llvm.org/

Improvements -
1. Ownership/Borrowing based memory management model
2. Smart pointers
3. Generics
4. Modern fixed-length type system, references
5. No implicit type conversions
6. Extended struct capabilities - for building abstractions
7. Improved function pointer syntax
8. Improved error handling
9. Improved inline (assembly, llvm ir) syntax - no_opt
